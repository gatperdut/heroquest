# Summary

Deprecated
=========
This tile set has been superseded by the much improved [OpenForge 2.0 Dungeon Stone](http://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-dungeon-stone-series) set.  

OpenForge
=========  
Dungeon floor tiles designed to be compatible with Dwarven Forge dungeon tiles.  This set has every tile size from 1x1 to 4x4 with 2 tiles for each non square size (e.g. 1x2, 2x1).  I did this to make OpenSCAD scripting easier, and figured they might as well all be released.

Updates  
----------  
* 1.0.1 : increased floor tile height by 500 microns to be as close to even as possible with Dwarven Forge tiles.  
* 1.0.2 : Added substantially more flooring faces which allowed the creation of 1x1 - 4x4
